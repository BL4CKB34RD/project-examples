#  The projects located in this directory were created as course work
# or as part of my private studies. Some work may have been created
# collaboratively with other students/peers while some are entirely my
# own creation. To the best of my ability, I have tried to give credit
# where it is due for collaborated work or "borrowed" snipets of code.
